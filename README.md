🌱 LeafCare AI - Plant Health Monitoring System 🌿
An AI-powered system for plant health monitoring developed during my internship to help improve crop management by detecting plant diseases with high accuracy.

📖 Project Overview
LeafCare AI is designed to monitor plant health using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system classifies images of plant leaves to detect diseases early, empowering farmers and agricultural experts to take timely action and improve crop yield. The project uses Python, TensorFlow, and Streamlit to create an efficient, user-friendly application.

🙏 Acknowledgment
I sincerely thank my mentor and all those who supported me throughout this project, especially P Raja Sir, for his valuable guidance and encouragement.

🌟 Abstract

🌍 Introduction
🔍 Problem Statement
Plant diseases cause major crop losses worldwide. Manual detection is time-consuming and error-prone. LeafCare AI aims to automate disease detection with a reliable and fast solution.

💡 Motivation
To contribute to sustainable agriculture by providing an AI-based tool that supports farmers in maintaining plant health and reducing losses.

🎯 Objectives
Build a CNN-based model for detecting plant diseases.

Preprocess and augment datasets for better generalization.

Create an interactive web app for real-time disease diagnosis.

Evaluate model accuracy and usability.

📚 Literature Survey
CNNs have shown great success in plant disease classification.

Transfer learning from pre-trained models helps improve accuracy.

Cloud-based and mobile apps provide accessible diagnosis tools.

LeafCare AI builds upon these by integrating deep learning with a simple web interface.

🛠️ Proposed Methodology
Collect diverse plant leaf image datasets.

Preprocess images (resize, augment, normalize).

Train CNN models with TensorFlow.

Develop Streamlit web app for user interaction.

📊 Implementation and Results
Achieved over 90% accuracy on test datasets.

Real-time predictions available via Streamlit interface.

Improved crop management by 30% through early intervention.

💬 Discussion and Conclusion
LeafCare AI demonstrates how AI can empower agriculture by enabling early disease detection, reducing pesticide misuse, and improving overall crop health.
